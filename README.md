Welcome to this exciting tutorial where we build a Supermarket Scanner from scratch! In this video, weâ€™ll create a web-based point-of-sale (POS) system that scans barcodes, manages a cart, and processes transactions with a custom QR code payment feature. Using Python (Flask) for the backend, JavaScript (QuaggaJS) for barcode scanning, and a sleek HTML/CSS frontend, this project is perfect for anyone interested in retail tech, web development, or DIY POS systems.

What youâ€™ll learn:
- Setting up a Flask server with SQLite for product and transaction management
- Real-time barcode scanning with QuaggaJS and a responsive web interface
- Adding products dynamically with category, manufacturer, price, and discount fields
- Generating QR codes for payments and integrating a Tkinter GUI for desktop use
- Making it mobile-friendly with modern CSS techniques
